# Shortest-Path-Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between a given node (the start node) and all other nodes in a graph. This algorithm uses the weights of the edges (or the distances) to find the path that minimizes the total distance (weight) between the source node and all other nodes. The code currently uses this graph, but is mutable:

The function can be used to determine the shortest path to a certain node by inputting a specific "target" as the parameter and will output the path taken.
